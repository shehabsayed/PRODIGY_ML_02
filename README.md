•	Data Exploration and Visualization:

  o	Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) by examining the dataset's structure and summary statistics.
  
  o	Visualized the distributions of features (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score) using histograms and box plots.
  
  o	Explored gender distribution through a pie chart.
  
  o	Investigated pairwise relationships between features using a pairplot.

•	Data Preprocessing:

  o	Encoded categorical variable 'Gender' into numerical form using LabelEncoder.

•	Determining Optimal Number of Clusters:

  o	Employed the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) by evaluating within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS) for a range of k values.

•	KMeans Clustering:

  o	Applied KMeans clustering algorithm to the dataset using the optimal number of clusters obtained from the Elbow Method.
  
  o	Visualized the clustering results by plotting data points colored by cluster labels and highlighting cluster centers.
  
  o	Executed KMeans clustering with different numbers of clusters (3, 4, and 5) and visualized the resulting clusters.

•	Voronoi Tessellation:

  o	Implemented Voronoi tessellation to depict the decision boundaries of the KMeans clustering algorithm in a 2D space.
  
  o	Visualized the Voronoi diagram along with the cluster centers and data points.
